### Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation 
## https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1

Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System   
while delivering presents to other planets!   
To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive,   
and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.  

The Elves quickly load you into a spacecraft and prepare to launch.

At the first *Go / No Go poll*, every Elf is Go until the Fuel Counter-Upper.  
They haven't determined the amount of fuel required yet.

Fuel required to launch a given module is based on its mass.  
Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.

What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft?

My answer is 3464735.

### previous code
If you remember, we already did Aoc 2019 Day 1 part 1

We opened the input file
``` python
filename=open("C:\\...\\2019day1.txt", "r") 
``` python
We read the file splitting the lines and we cast each string to an integer
``` python
spacecraftMod = filename.read().splitlines()
spacecraftMod = [int(i) for i in spacecraftMod]
```
We declared a variable to keep track of fuel requirements
``` python
fuelReq = 0
```
We used a FOR loop to calculate the fuel requirements for each line in the input  
``` python
for mass in spacecraftMod:
    fuelReq += (mass//3)-2
```
And finally we printed the result
``` python
print("Sum of the fuel requirements for all the modules: ",fuelReq)
```
### part 1 - REDONE with a FUNCTION
You could have gone another way. The first lines are the same.
``` python
filename=open("C:\\...\\2019day1.txt", "r") 
spacecraftMod = filename.read().splitlines()
spacecraftMod = [int(i) for i in spacecraftMod]
```
You can DEFINE A FUNCTION. We start with the keyword **def**,    
then you choose a name for our function (*fuel*) and, between parenthesis, we put the argument(s) accepted by our function.  
In this problem, we want a function that takes a *mass* and returns the value of the mass divided by 3, rounded to the floor, minus 2  
``` python
def fuel(mass):
    return (mass // 3) - 2
```
Now, back to our code, we can modify the FOR loop by calling our new function *fuel* with the *mass* as an argument with **fuel(mass)***
```python
fuelReq = 0
for mass in spacecraftMod:
    fuelReq += fuel(mass)
   
print("Sum of the fuel requirements for all the modules: ",fuelSum)
```
Try and you'll see that the result is still the same.  
Why should you use a function instead of simply writing the logic inside the FOR loop?  
Because sometimes you have problems that require a RECURSIVE strategy!  

## part 2  
Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.  
However, that fuel also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on.   
Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel;  
the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass   
and is outside the scope of this calculation.

So, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total.   
Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat the process,  
continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative. For example:

For example, you have a module with mass 1969.  
(1969 // 3) - 2 = 654   
(654 // 3) - 2 = 216  
(216 // 3) - 2 = 70  
(70 // 3) - 2 = 21  
(21 // 3) - 2 = 5  
(5 // 3) - 2 = -1  
-1 is less than 0, so we can stop and return 0  
The total fuel needed by this module is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966  

Basically, you need to keep doing the same calculation until you reach zero or less than zero,  
and that's why you need a recursive function: a function that does something 
and then calls itself with the result of the calculation as an argument. The recursion stops when a certain requirement is met.  

What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft?  

My puzzle answer is 5194211  

Let's start with the function you already wrote  
``` python
def fuel(mass):
    return (mass // 3) - 2
```
Define a new function, FUNCTION, that takes a mass as its only ARGUMENT  
``` python
def FUNCTION(ARGUMENT):
```
To calculate the remaining mass, use the FUEL function you defined before
``` python
    VARNAME1 = fuel(ARGUMENT)
```
If this varname1 is less than or equal to 0, you can stop and return 0
``` python
    if (VARNAME1 <= 0):
        return 0
```
otherwise, you need to keep calculating how much fuel you need by returning   
the fuel you need now + the extra fuel that you calculate by calling 
the function again, this time with the remaining mass
``` python
    else:
        return VARNAME1 + FUNCTION(VARNAME1)
```

Finally, you need to declare a new variable to keep track of all the fuel needed, VARNAME2  
``` python
VARNAME2 = INTEGER
```

and write a FOR loop that calculates the fuel needed by each module (line\)  
``` python
for i in spacecraftMod:
   VARNAME2 += FUNCTION(i)

print("Recursive sum of the fuel requirements for all the modules: ", VARNAME2)
```
