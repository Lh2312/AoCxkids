################# Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ################# https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1 #################
# Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment 
# building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. 
# He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.
#
# An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), 
# means he should go down one floor.
#
# Part 1: To what floor do the instructions take Santa?
# My answer: 138
# 

# open the input and read it. Your input is a long long line of parentheses,
# representing floors, choose an appropriate [VARNAME1]
filename=open("C:\\...\\2015Day1.txt", "r") 
[VARNAME1] = filename.read()

# you need a counter to keep track of what floor Santa is [VARNAME2]. 
# Santa starts on floor 0, choose an [INT] to assign to your [VARNAME2]
[VARNAME2] = [INT]

# you need to loop through each symbol in your input, choose a [VARNAME3] that will represent each step
for [VARNAME3] in [VARNAME1]:

# what happens if the symbol is "("?
# you need to increase your [VARNAME2] by 1 floor
# remember that a [STATEMENT] is a logical condition that can be == (equal), != (not equal), > (greater than) etc.
    if ([STATEMENT]):
        [INCREASE VARNAME2 by 1]
# Else if the symbol is ")", you need to decrease [VARNAME2]
    elif [(STATEMENT]):
        [DECREASE VARNAME2 by 1]

# you can now print your [VARNAME2] and submit your answer :)
print ([VARNAME2)

# Part 2: Now, given the same instructions, find the position of the first character that causes him to enter 
# the basement (floor -1). 
# The first character in the instructions has position 1, the second character has position 2, and so on.
# Example: ()())
# position 1: ( -> floor 1
# position 2: ) -> floor 0
# position 3: ( -> floor 1
# position 4: ) -> floor 0
# position 5: ) -> floor -1
#
# my answer: 1771

# you need a new variable to keep track of the symbols' position
# add [VARNAME4]=[INT] right after [VARNAME2]=[INT]
# Pay attention to the text: "The first character in the instructions has position 1"
# and choose an appropriate first value
[VARNAME2]=[INT]
[VARNAME4]=[INT]

# go to your for loop, it should look like this:
for [VARNAME3] in [VARNAME1]:
    if ([STATEMENT]):
        [INCREASE VARNAME2 by 1]
    elif [(STATEMENT]):
        [DECREASE VARNAME2 by 1]
        
# add an IF statement that checks if Santa is on floor -1
# Your statement should check if [VARNAME4] is == -1
    if ([STATEMENT]):
# if the statement is true, Santa is on floor -1
# and you can just print your [VARNAME4] to find the position
        print([VARNAME4])
# you don't need to proceed any further, so you can BREAK out of the loop
        break

# finally, don't forget to update your [VARNAME4] after the IFs but still inside the FOR :)
    [VARNAME4]+=1
