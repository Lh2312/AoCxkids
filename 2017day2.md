## Day 2: Corruption Checksum
### https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/2
The spreadsheet consists of rows of apparently-random numbers. 
To make sure the recovery process is on the right track,   
they need you to calculate the spreadsheet's checksum. 

For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value;  
the checksum is the sum of all of these differences.  

For example, if your input is:  
5 1 9 5               the largest value is 9, the smallest is 1. 9-1 = 8  
7 5 3                 the largest value is 7, the smallest is 3. 7-3 = 4  
2 4 6 8               the largest value is 8, the smallest is 2. 8-2 = 6  
The checksum is the sum of 8 + 4 + 6 = 18

My answer: 41919


Open the input and read it. Your input is a string of numbers separated by a tab.  
 ``` python
filename=open("C:\\...\\2017Day2txt", "r") 
```
Read the input file into VARNAME1, your spreadsheet
``` python
VARNAME1 = filename.read().splitlines()
```
Let's clean the data, you have two problems:  
1) the symbols in each line are separated by a tab -> get rid of all the "\t"  
2) the symbols in each line are strings and not numbers  
Your spreadsheet is VARNAME1, while VARNAME2 is one row in the spreadsheet  
``` python
VARNAME1 = [VARNAME2.split("\t") for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1]
VARNAME1 = [list(map(int, VARNAME2)) for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1]
```
Declare a VARNAME3 to keep track of your checksum  
``` python
VARNAME3 = INTEGER
```
Write your FOR loop  
Find the difference between the largest and the smallest numbers in each row.  
You can use the functions MAX() and MIN()  
```python
for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1:
    VARNAME3 += max(VARNAME2) - min(VARNAME2)
```
All done, print your VARNAME3 and validate your result in AoC :)
``` python
print("checksum:",VARNAME3)
```
## Part 2
"Based on what we're seeing,   
it looks like all the User wanted is some information about   
the evenly divisible values in the spreadsheet.  
Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind of calculation  
- most of us specialize in bitwise operations."

It sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row  
where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of   
the division operation is a whole number.  
They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.

For example, given the following spreadsheet:  
5 9 2 8          the only two numbers that evenly divide are 8 and 2; the result of this division is 4  
9 4 7 3          the only two numbers that evenly divide are 9 and 3; the result of this division is 3  
3 8 6 5          the only two numbers that evenly divide are 6 and 3; the result of this division is 2  
The sum of the results would be 4 + 3 + 2 = 9  

What is the sum of each row's result in your puzzle input?  

Let's reset the checksum
``` python
VARNAME3 = INTEGER
```

Now, for EACH ROW, you need to compare EACH NUMBER with EVERY OTHER number.  
This means you need 3 FOR loops: one for the rows and 2 for the numbers.  
``` python
for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1:
    for i in VARNAME2:
        for j in VARNAME2:
```
How do you check if one number evenly divides another one?  
You use the MODULO operator we saw on Day 1:  
if the remainder of a division is 0, then the number evenly divides the other  
So you need a STATEMENT1 to check if i%j is zero  
and a STATEMENT2 to check that the two numbers are different. To do so, use the operator != between i and j.  
(because, obviously, a number divided by itself has no remainder)
``` python
            if (STATEMENT1) and (STATEMENT2):
```
If both statements are true, you can increase the checksum by the quotient, i divided by j  
You can use the operator / for the division, or // to divide and round it to the floor (better)
```python
                VARNAME3 += QUOTIENT
```
All done, print your VARNAME3 and validate your result in AoC :)
``` python
print("checksum:",VARNAME3)
```

## CODE WITHOUT COMMENTS 
``` python
# input reading
filename=open("C:\\...\\2017Day2txt", "r") 
VARNAME1 = filename.read().splitlines()

# data cleaning
VARNAME1 = [VARNAME2.split("\t") for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1]
VARNAME1 = [list(map(int, VARNAME2)) for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1]

# part 1
VARNAME3 = INTEGER

for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1:
    VARNAME3 += max(VARNAME2) - min(VARNAME2)

print("checksum:",VARNAME3)

# part 2
VARNAME3 = INTEGER

for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1:
    for i in VARNAME2:
        for j in VARNAME2:
            if (STATEMENT1) and (STATEMENT2):
                VARNAME3 += QUOTIENT

print("checksum:",VARNAME3)
```
