# The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. 
# They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and 
# only want to order exactly as much as they need.
#
# Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), 
# which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: 
# find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. 
#
# The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.
#
# For example, a present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2*2*3 + 2*3*4 + 2*4*2 = 52 square feet 
# of wrapping paper. The smallest side is 2*3 = 6, for a total of 52+6=58 square feet.

# My answer: 1598415
