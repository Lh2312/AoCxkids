## Day 1: Inverse Captcha
### https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1 
You're standing in a room with "digitization quarantine" written in LEDs along one wall.   
The only door is locked, but it includes a small interface. "Restricted Area - Strictly No Digitized Users Allowed."  
It goes on to explain that you may only leave by solving a captcha to prove you're not a human.   
Apparently, you only get one millisecond to solve the captcha: too fast for a normal human, but it feels like hours to you.  

The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input)   
and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list.   
The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.  

For example, if you have 31145553  
compare 3 and 1, they are different, so nothing happens  
compare 1 and 1, they are the same, so your counter will increase by 1  
compare 1 and 4, different  
compare 4 and 5, different  
compare 5 and 5, same, your counter will be 1 + 5 = 6  
compare 5 and 5, still same, your counter will be 6 + 5 = 11  
compare 5 and 3, different  
now you have reached the end of the string: go back  
and compare the last symbol with the first one  
compare 3 and 3, same, your counter will be 11 + 3 = 14  

My answer: 1031    


Open the input and read it. Your input is a long string of numbers.  
(so, they are numbers, but for Python they are like letters)  
``` python
filename=open("C:\\...\\2017Day1txt", "r") 
```
Read the input file into VARNAME1    
``` python
VARNAME1 = filename.read() 
```
Sometimes, at the end of the file, there is a new line character that you cannot  
see, but it will mess up when you try to work with your numbers  
Let's STRIP it, just in case.
``` python
VARNAME1 =VARNAME1.strip("\n")
```
Declare a new variable to keep track of the sum of matching symbols
``` python
VARNAME2 = INTEGER
```
Start a FOR loop. You need 2 variables,  
the first one, VARNAME3, will check a symbol  
the second one, VARNAME4, will check the following one (so it will start from position 1)  
``` python
for VARNAME3, VARNAME4 in zip(VARNAME1, VARNAME1[1:]):
```
You need an IF statement to check if a symbol is equal == to the next one  
Those symbols are in VARNAME3 and VARNAME4  
``` python
    if (STATEMENT):
```
If your statement is true, your symbols are the same and   
you can increase the counter in VARNAME2
This variable is still a string, you need to cast it to an integer with INT()
``` python
        VARNAME2+=int(VARNAME3)
```
Last, you need to check the first and the last symbol  
The last symbol in a string can be retrieved by using the position -1  
Write a statement to compare VARNAME1[0\], the first character, with VARNAME1[-1\], the last one
``` python
if (STATEMENT):
```
If the statement is true, increase your counter  
``` python
    VARNAME2+=int(VARNAME1[-1])
```
All done, print your counter and validate your answer in AoC
``` python
print ("Captcha: ", VARNAME2)
```

## Part 2: The elves are not sure you are NOT human  
Now, instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider   
the digit halfway around the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10 items,   
only include a digit in your sum if the digit 10/2 = 5 steps forward matches it.   
Fortunately, your list has an even number of elements.

For example, you have a string of 8 characters, 12131415  
Compare the first character with the character 8\2= 4 steps ahead  
Position 0 -> "1"         Position 4 -> "1"             Same, counter = 1  
Position 1 -> "2"         Position 5 -> "4"             Different  
Position 2 -> "1"         Position 6 -> "1"             Same, counter = 1 + 1 = 2  
Position 3 -> "3"         Position 7 -> "5"             Different  

Pay attention: you reached the end of the string,    
but you need to keep comparing going back to the first character.    

Position 4 -> "1"         Position 0 -> "6"             Same, counter = 2 + 1 = 3  
Position 5 -> "4"         Position 1 -> "7"             Different  
Position 6 -> "1"         Position 2 -> "1"             Same, counter = 3 + 1 = 4  
Position 7 -> "3"         Position 3 -> "5"             Different  
Your total is 4   

Your problem is: how do you go from position 7 to position 0?  
Use the MODULO operator: %  
Modulo is a math operation that finds the remainder when one integer is divided by another.  
For example:  
5%2 is 1, because 5:2 = 2 with a remainder of 1  
15%4 is 3, because 15:4 = 3 with a remainder of 3  

My answer is: 1080 

Start by resetting your counter in VARNAME2
``` python
VARNAME2 = INTEGER
```
Declare a new variable, VARNAME5.  
This variable will have the value of half the length of your string,
You can use the function LEN()  
``` python
VARNAME5 = int(len(VARNAME1)/2)
```
Start your FOR loop.  
This time, we will simply use a variable i as an index, and our loop will go from 0 to the length of the string  
(twice the step)  
``` python
for i in (VARNAME5*2):
```
Compare the symbol in position [i\] with the symbol in position [(i+VARNAME5)%(VARNAME5*2)\]  
``` python
    if (STATEMENT):
```
If the statement is true, you can increase your counter by the integer that is in position [i\] in your string  
``` python
        VARNAME2+=int(VARNAME2[i])
```
All done, print your counter and validate your result in AoC :)    
``` python
print ("Captcha: ", VARNAME2)
````

## CODE WITHOUT COMMENTS 
``` python
filename=open("C:\\...\\2017Day1txt", "r") 
VARNAME1 = filename.read() 
VARNAME1 =VARNAME1.strip("\n")

# part 1
VARNAME2 = INTEGER

for VARNAME3, VARNAME4 in zip(VARNAME1, VARNAME1[1:]):
    if (STATEMENT):
        VARNAME2+=int(VARNAME3)
if (STATEMENT):
    VARNAME2+=int(VARNAME1[-1])
print ("Captcha: ", VARNAME2)

# part 2
VARNAME2 = INTEGER
VARNAME5 = int(len(VARNAME1)/2)

for i in (VARNAME5*2):
    if (STATEMENT):
        VARNAME2+=int(VARNAME2[i])

print ("Captcha: ", VARNAME2)
````

## WORKING CODE 
``` python 
filename=open("/Users/ec/Desktop/AoC2016/2017Day1.txt", "r") 
captcha = filename.read() 
captcha =captcha.strip("\n")

# part 1
counter = 0

for symbol, nextSymbol in zip(captcha, captcha[1:]):
    if (symbol==nextSymbol):
        counter+=int(symbol)

if (captcha[0]==captcha[-1]):
    counter+=int(captcha[-1])
    
print ("Captcha: ", counter)

# part 2
counter = 0
step=int(len(captcha)/2)

for i in range(step*2):
    if (captcha[i]==captcha[(i+step)%(step*2)]):
        counter+=int(captcha[i])
    
print ("Captcha: ", counter)
```
