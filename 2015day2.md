## Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math
### https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2 
The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. 
They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and 
only want to order exactly as much as they need.  

Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), 
which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: 
find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. 

The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.

For example, your input might be 2x3x4, meaning the present is a box
with dimensions 2x3x4 that  requires 2*2*3 + 2*3*4 + 2*4*2 = 52 square feet 
of wrapping paper. The smallest side for extra paper is 2*3 = 6, for a total of 52+6=58 square feet.

My answer: 1598415


open the input and read it. Your input is a list of dimensions that represent 
length * width * height but in the form: 2x3x4 

open the input
``` python
filename=open("C:\\...\\2015Day2.txt", "r") 
```
read the input file into VARNAME1
``` python
VARNAME1 = filename.read()
```
VARNAME1 is now single very long list of “l*w*h\n”
you want a list with one package per line
``` python
VARNAME1 = VARNAME1.splitlines()
```
ALTERNATIVELY you could replace the last 2 instructions with just
``` python
VARNAME1 = filename.read().splitlines()
```
you want to get rid of those useless "x" in between your dimensions
you can use a FOR loop, but this time we'll write it in this
different form:   
``` python

VARNAME1 = [VARNAME2.split('x') for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1]
```
look at VARNAME1 in your variable explorer window
each line should be something like '2', '3', '4'
you need to do some math with these numbers, but right now they are strings (see the quotation marks?)
next step will be casting them to integers with MAP
``` python
VARNAME1 = [list(map(int, VARNAME2)) for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1]
```
look again at VARNAME1 in your variable explorer window
each line should be something like 2, 3, 4
no more quotation marks! These are INTEGERS, and you are ready to do some math

declare a new variable to keep track of how much paper your will need.
at the beginning, you have no paper at all
``` python
VARNAME3 = INTEGER
```
let's start the FOR loop
``` python
for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1:
```
in VARNAME2 you have three values, length, width and height of each package
the length is the value in position 0: VARNAME2[0]
the width is the value in position 1: VARNAME2[1]
the height is the value in position 2: VARNAME2[2]
Attention: 0 1 and 2 need brackets, if your VARNAME2 is pluto, you'll have pluto[0], pluto[1], pluto[2]

in VARNAME4 you'll put 3 new numbers, representing the areas of the three different sides you have
in a rectangular prism (these numbers are in brackets)
VARNAME4 = length*width   width*height   length *height
 ``` python
   
VARNAME4 =  VARNAME2[0]*VARNAME2[1], VARNAME2[1]*VARNAME2[2], VARNAME2[0]*VARNAME2[2] 
```
now you can calculate how much paper you need:
two * the sum of the sides + the SMALLER side as extra paper
to find the smaller side, you can use the function MIN, 
that will return you the least of the 3 areas
    ``` python
VARNAME3 += 2*(VARNAME4[0] + VARNAME4[1] + VARNAME[4]) + min(VARNAME4)
```
all done, just print the value of your VARNAME3 out of the loop
``` python
print (VARNAME3)
```

## Part 2: The elves are also running low on ribbon. 
Ribbon is all the same width, so they only have to worry about the length they need to order, 
which they would again like to be exact.

The ribbon required to wrap a present is the shortest distance around its sides, 
or the smallest perimeter of any one face. 

Each present also requires a bow made out of ribbon as well; 
the feet of ribbon required for the perfect bow is equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present. 
Don't ask how they tie the bow, though; they'll never tell.

For example: you have a present with dimensions 2x3x4.
the SMALLEST SIDE is 2x3 
the perimeter of the smallest side is 2*(2+3) = 10
and then you need the volume, 2*3*4 = 24 for the bow
in total, you need 34 feet of ribbon

How many total feet of ribbon should they order?

my answer is: 3812909

add this code after your last PRINT instruction
declare a new variable to keep track you how much ribbon you need

``` python
VARNAME5 = INTEGER

for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1:
```
remember that in VARNAME2 you have three values, length, width, and height of each package
the length is the value in position 0: VARNAME2[0]
the width is the value in position 1: VARNAME2[1]
the height is the value in position 2: VARNAME2[2]

to find the perimeter of the smallest side, you can sort the values in VARNAME2
using the function SORTED
so that now in VARNAME2[0] and VARNAME2[1] you have the 2 smaller values
``` python
    VARNAME2 = sorted(VARNAME2)
```
now you simply update VARNAME5 adding the perimeter of the smallest side
and the volume of the package
perimeter = 2*(sum of the two smaller sides, the ones in VARNAME2[0] and VARNAME2[1])
volume = product of the three values in VARNAME2[0], VARNAME2[1], VARNAME2[2]
``` python
    VARNAME5 += PERIMETER + VOLUME
```
all done, just print the value of your VARNAME3 out of the loop
``` python
print (VARNAME5)
```
## CODE WITHOUT COMMENTS 
``` python
filename=open("C:\\...\\2015Day2.txt", "r") 
VARNAME1 = filename.read()
VARNAME1 = VARNAME1.splitlines()

VARNAME1 = [VARNAME2.split('x') for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1]
VARNAME1 = [list(map(int, VARNAME2)) for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1]

# part 1
VARNAME3 = INTEGER

for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1:
    VARNAME4 =  VARNAME2[0]*VARNAME2[1], VARNAME2[1]*VARNAME2[2], VARNAME2[0]*VARNAME2[2] 
    VARNAME3 += 2*(VARNAME4[0] + VARNAME4[1] + VARNAME[4]) + min(VARNAME4)

print (VARNAME3)

# part 2
VARNAME5 = INTEGER

for VARNAME2 in VARNAME1:
    VARNAME2 = sorted(VARNAME2)
    VARNAME5 += PERIMETER + VOLUME
print (VARNAME5)
```
## WORKING CODE 
```python
filename=open("C:\\...\\2015Day2.txt", "r") 
packages = filename.read().splitlines() #reading input txt file
    
packages = [package.split('x') for package in packages]
packages = [list(map(int, package)) for package in packages]

paper = 0
for package in packages:
    sides = [ package[0]*package[1], package[1]*package[2], package[0]*package[2] ]
    paper += 2*(sides[0] + sides[1] + sides[2]) + min(sides)
print ("Square feet of paper:",paper)


ribbon = 0

for package in packages:
    package = sorted(package)
    ribbon += 2*(package[0]+package[1]) + package[0]*package[1]*package[2] 
print ("feet of ribbon:",ribbon)
```
